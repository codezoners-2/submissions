# number generator

All of the following steps can be inside a setup() function, since we only want to run the code once.

### step-by-step:
1. Create an array that takes 10 variables of type int.
2. Write a for loop that fills the positions of the array with random numbers from 1-10 and print (using the println() command) the content of each cell in the array.
3. Caclulate the sum of all the random numbers in the array by using a for loop to loop through the positions and add them together (hint: you have to create an int variable to hold the total, before printing it out in the end of the setup() function.
